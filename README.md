### 👨‍💻 About Me

With over 5 years of professional experience in mobile development, I specialize in designing, building, and maintaining scalable applications using Flutter & Dart.

I’ve led and contributed to full app lifecycles — from defining architecture and building core components to modifying and extending large codebases. Whether developing from scratch or enhancing existing systems, I ensure clean, modular, and maintainable code using Clean Architecture and Bloc.

My work spans sectors like education, e-commerce, healthcare, and delivery — including real-time features, chat, authentication, and multi-role user flows. I also mentor junior developers and improve team workflows through code standards and component reuse.
