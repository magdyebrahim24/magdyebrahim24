### 👨‍💻 About Me

With over 5 years of professional experience in mobile development, I specialize in designing, building, and maintaining scalable applications using **Flutter & Dart**. I’ve worked across sectors like education, e-commerce, healthcare, and delivery — building real-time chat systems, authentication flows, and multi-role platforms.

I’ve led and contributed to complete app lifecycles — from architecting modular codebases and shared components to modifying and extending legacy systems. Whether developing from scratch or enhancing existing apps, I apply Clean Architecture and Bloc to ensure performance, maintainability, and scalability.

✅ Key Highlights:
- 🧱 Designed base app structures for multi-app platforms (User, Provider, Delivery)  
- 🔁 Refactored and extended codebases with scalable, clean code practices  
- 🔒 Built robust authentication flows using Firebase/Auth APIs  
- 📦 Integrated real-time features (chat, notifications, maps, media uploads)  
- 🧩 Developed shared UI systems, reusable components, and flavor-based environments  
- 👥 Collaborated with product managers and cross-functional teams in Agile settings  
- 🤝 Mentored junior developers and enforced clean code standards across teams
